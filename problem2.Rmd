# load libraries and dataset

load the libraries and dataset of NYC restaurant inspections
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

library(p8105.datasets)
data("rest_inspec")
```

# import and clean data

i want to focus on restaurants in Manhattan, which have records of grade in 'A', 'B', or 'C' and have record of critical flag in "Critical" or "Not Critical"
```{r}
inspection_df =
  rest_inspec |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(boro, grade, zipcode, critical_flag, score) |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  filter(boro == "MANHATTAN" & grade %in% c("A", "B", "C") & critical_flag %in% c("Critical", "Not Critical"))
```
